# Receipt Processor Challenge in Java
My name is Dan Wright, and this is my code repo for Fetch's Back-End Apprenticeship coding assessment.

# Things you need to know before running:

 1. This project was written using Java 17. Whether you have Java on your machine or not, it's not a problem. I have provided a Dockerfile that can help you regardless of OS or language.
 2. Something you will  need to run this app is some kind of API Platform, or command-line based tool to make HTTP requests. I personally am a fan of [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), but other tools like SoapUI or curl will get the job done, too.
